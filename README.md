## PanCake Stars

---

Pancake Stars is a game created by Kathy Reid for the 3AI 2021 Cohort as a way in which to interrogate system requirements, system complexity and have fun eating pancackes. I created this interface as part of a build homework assignment, connecting two systems together (in this case the game system with the moderators)
